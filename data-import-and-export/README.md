# Data Import and Export

Open Journal Systems offers a variety of tools and plugins which allow you to inject data into and extract data from OJS. This chapter explains how to use import and export tools and plugins. More information can be found in each plugin's documentation within OJS' plugin directory \(plugins/\).

Most import and export functions can be carried out by logging in as Journal Manager and going to `Tools` &gt; `Import/Export`.

However, in some cases import/export plugins need to be installed or enabled first under `Settings` &gt; `Website` &gt; `Plugins`. How to access and use specific plugins and functions are explained in the sections below.

Import/export functionality is also available as a command-line tool; see `tools/importExport.php` and the command line section for more information.
